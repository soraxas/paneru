//! Tests for `Operation::FocusOrVirtual` (bound as e.g.
//! `window_virtualfocus_north`/`_south`): focuses a stack neighbor
//! above/below if one exists, otherwise switches the virtual workspace like
//! `Operation::Virtual` would — see `switch_virtual_workspace_bind` in
//! `src/ecs/workspace.rs`. Deliberately a separate command from
//! `Operation::Virtual` (`window_virtual_north`/`_south`), which must keep
//! meaning exactly "switch workspace", unconditionally.
